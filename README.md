# Learn Cloud Native AI Powered Microservices Design and Development

This repo is part of the [Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15usu1hkrrRLRjcq_3nCTT-0ljEcgiC44iSdvdqrCprk/edit?usp=sharing) program. It covers the third quarter of the course work:

## Quarter 3: Cloud Native AI Powered Microservices Design and Development

Build scalable AI Powered APIs using FastAPI, Postgres, Kafka, Kong, GenAI APIs like OpenAI Chat Completion APIs, Assistant APIs, LangChain and Open Source AI LLMs, develop them using Containers and Dev Containers, 
and deploy them using Docker Compose. 

We will also learn to integrate design thinking and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in developing AI systems. We will learn to create AI solutions that are deeply aligned with user needs and expectations. 
Design thinking ensures a thorough understanding of the user and problem space, while BDD provides a structured approach to defining and validating the desired behaviours of the AI system. 
Together, these methodologies lead to the development of AI solutions that are not only technically robust but also highly user-centric and effective in solving real-world problems.
